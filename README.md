# Image Generation: GAN vs VAE Comparison

![Project Banner](https://github.com/hash2004/image-generation-GAN-vs-VAE/blob/main/results/vae_epoch_050.png)

## üìã Overview

This project compares two popular deep learning architectures for image generation: **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** and **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**. Both models were trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset to evaluate their performance, stability, and quality of generated images.

## üîç Key Findings

Our experiments revealed that **VAEs outperformed GANs** in this particular task. The key reasons include:

- **Training Stability**: VAEs demonstrated more stable training behavior
- **Optimization Efficiency**: VAEs converged more effectively
- **Latent Space Structure**: VAEs produced a more structured latent representation
- **Better Compatibility**: VAEs worked particularly well with the CIFAR-10 dataset

For detailed analysis, see the complete comparison notebook.

### VAE Results (50 epochs)

Note how the VAE achieved comparable or better results with half the training epochs!

## ‚è±Ô∏è Development Constraints

- **Training Time:** The entire training process took approximately 1 hour to generate both models. With more computational resources and training time, both models could produce significantly better results.

- **Development Time:** This project code was completed in just 1.5-2 hours. The code can be further optimized and architectures refined with additional development time.

## üß† Why VAE Trained Better Than GAN

1. **Training Stability**
   - VAEs optimize a variational lower bound, providing a stable and gradual training process
   - GANs rely on adversarial training which can lead to instability and mode collapse

2. **Optimization Process**
   - VAEs use a probabilistic encoder-decoder architecture ensuring smooth convergence
   - GANs require reaching a Nash equilibrium between generator and discriminator‚Äîinherently more challenging

3. **Latent Space Representation**
   - VAEs explicitly model the latent space as a probabilistic distribution
   - This structured latent space helps VAEs generate diverse outputs without mode collapse

4. **Dataset Compatibility**
   - CIFAR-10's relatively simple structure favors the encoder-decoder approach of VAEs
   - GANs often require extensive tuning to avoid artifacts on simpler datasets
